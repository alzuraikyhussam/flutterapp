# `flutter-counter-tdd`

</div>

# _Why_? ðŸ¤·


The **_objective_** of the application 
that will be created is to explain 
**_step by step_** the creation of a Flutter application 
using the **_TDD_**.<br />



# _What_? ðŸ’­

The TDD is a **_method or approach_** used in programming 
where the objective is to write a **_test_** (a function, a class or method) 
so that it fails, to be added later only the code necessary for the test to pass.


> We have built a _small counter application_ 
to be understood by all beginners. 
To build this tutorial we use the TDD method which is used in several languages.
The result of this _tutorial_ is much **simpler** 
to understand and beyond the **step by step** has
the **complete code** of the application.


>To learn more about how TDD works and how it can be used, 
this repository has all the essential information: https://github.com/dwyl/learn-tdd

# _Who_? ðŸ‘¥

This tutorial is intended for all people who are _learning_
more about **_Flutter_** and who are looking 
to learn how to use the **_TDD correctly_**.
It was made for all **beginners** without previous _experience/knowledge_.

# _How_? âœ…

Before creating a project, make sure you 
have installed Flutter and all the toolkits necessary
to create a Flutter application.
If you're _just_ starting out, 
please visit our [`learn_flutter`](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-flutter)]
repo to have detailed instructions to get your dev env properly setup
and have all the necessary extensions in Visual Studio installed.

In this tutorial we will be using Visual Studio
as our main IDE. This is mainly because 
it's much easier to bootstrap and
run an emulator to test our application.

## 1. Project setup

Let's kickstart our project. 
After you've installed VSCode and added the extensions,
click on `View > Command Pallete` and click.
This will prompt a text bot. Type `Flutter`
and choose the `Flutter: New Project` option.
Give the app name whatever you want. 
Note that this will affect the imports, so if you want 
to strictly follow with this tutorial, name it `counter_app`.

After this, a `counter_app` folder will be created.

```sh
cd counter_app
```

To write our tests, we are going to need to add
two packages. Open the `pubspec.yaml` file and
add the following lines to the `dev-dependency` section.

```yaml
equatable: ^2.0.5
shared_preferences: ^2.0.15
```

We are using [`equatable`](https://pub.dev/packages/equatable)
because it allows us to compare objects in a much easier manner,
without having to write boilerplate to compare their values
directly or without any overrides. 
If you are interested in how `equatable` works, 
check their documentation.

We are also adding [`shared_preferences`](https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences)
because it is needed to install `equatable`.

After adding these two lines to the `pubspec.yaml` file,
run the following command to download and install the dependencies.

```sh
flutter pub get
```

## 2. Structuring our project

After creating the Flutter project, 
let's two directories inside the `lib` folder 
(which will contain all the source code). 
Create the `domain` folder and then create the `presentation` folder.
Inside the `test` folder, create a `widget` and `unit` folder,
which will refer to the widget testing and unit testing
we will implement, respectively. 


## 3. Write the first tests and implement app

Since we know what are will *will do*, we can infer
that a class named `Counter` will probably be needed.
This class will hold the value of the counter. 

In order to perform the tests,
we must first `create a class with functions` - the `Counter` class.
These functions in the case of this project
are `increment` and `decrement`.

For that inside the `domain` folder, 
create a file called `counter.dart`.<br />

Inside the `counter.dart` file,
let's initialize the class.

```dart
import 'package:equatable/equatable.dart';

class Counter extends Equatable {
  int value = 0;

  @override
  List<Object> get props => [value];
}
```
We will have a `value` that will start at 0 to `count` the numbers.
Additionally, the reason we implemented the `get props` 
function is because we are **extending** Equatable,
and it's needed to properly compare the object's values.

Inside the `unit` folder that is inside the `test`folder we have created,
create `counter_test.dart`. 
This will be used to create and run all the necessary `tests`
on the `Counter` class.

Our `first test` will be for the initial value to start at 0.

```dart
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';
import 'package:counter_app_tdd/Domain/counter.dart';

void main() {
  group('Counter', () {
    test('value should start at 0', () {
      expect(Counter().value, 0);
    });
   });
}
```
The `second test` will be used to check
if the value is being `incremented` and if it's
only being increased *one by one*.

```dart
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';
import 'package:counter_app_tdd/Domain/counter.dart';

void main() {
  group('Counter', () {
    test('value should start at 0', () {
      expect(Counter().value, 0);
    });
    
     test('value should be incremented', () {
      final counter = Counter();

      counter.increment();

      expect(counter.value, 1);

    });
    
   });
}
```

And the `third test` will be to know if clicking on the decrement button decreases the value and if only is taken out one by one.

```dart
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';
import 'package:counter_app_tdd/Domain/counter.dart';

void main() {
  group('Counter', () {
    test('value should start at 0', () {
      expect(Counter().value, 0);
    });

    test('value should be incremented', () {
      final counter = Counter();

      counter.increment();

      expect(counter.value, 1);

    });

    test('value should be decremented', () {
      final counter = Counter();

      counter.decrement();

      expect(counter.value, -1);


    });
  });
}
```
If we run the `tests` using the `flutter test`, 
we'll see the test fail. This is expected, 
as the functions that were used in the tests aren't yet implemented.

To pass the tests, head over to the `counter.dart` file 
and add the `increment` and `decrement` functions. 

```dart
import 'package:equatable/equatable.dart';

class Counter extends Equatable {
  int value = 0;

  increment() => value++;
  decrement() => value--;

  @override
  // TODO: implement props
  List<Object> get props => [value];
}
```

This way the tests will `pass`.

<img width="661" alt="test_pass" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17494745/201917161-ccbc3445-10d1-4eb2-8b03-9f50e9e6f8e0.png">

For our homepage, we will create a file inside the `presentation` folder
with the name `counter_page.dart`.
While we are at it, let's change `main.dart` to 
call this `counter_page` we will going to implement. 

```dart
import 'package:counter_app/presentation/counter_page.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

// coverage:ignore-start
void main() {
  runApp(const MyApp());
}
// coverage:ignore-end

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});

  // This widget is the root of your application.
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: const CounterPage(title: 'Counter App Demo'),
    );
  }
}
```
The `main` function calls `MyApp`, 
which in turn sets up the `MateiralApp` that calls the
`CounterPage`, the same page we will now create. 
Do notice we are surrounding the `main()` function
with `coverage:ignore-start` and `coverage:ignore-end`
so test coverage will be properly run. 
The `main()` function is not usually testable, 
so we skip it.

All the settings in the appearance 
of our application will be made in the file `counter_page.dart`.
Change the file so it looks like the following.

```dart
import 'package:counter_app/domain/counter.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class CounterPage extends StatefulWidget {
  const CounterPage({super.key, required this.title});

  final String title;

  @override
  State<CounterPage> createState() => _CounterPageState();
}

class _CounterPageState extends State<CounterPage> {
  Counter _counter = Counter();

  void _incrementCounter() {
    setState(() {
      _counter.increment();
    });
  }

  void _decrementCounter() {
    setState(() {
      _counter.decrement();
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text(widget.title),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            const Text(
              'You have pushed the button this many times:',
            ),
            Text(
              _counter.value.toString(),
              style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headline4,
            ),
            Row(
              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceAround,
              children: [
                FloatingActionButton(
                  onPressed: _decrementCounter,
                  tooltip: 'Decrement',
                  child: const Icon(Icons.remove),
                ),
                FloatingActionButton(
                  onPressed: _incrementCounter,
                  tooltip: 'Increment',
                  child: const Icon(Icons.add),
                ),
              ],
            )

          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Let's go through what we just wrote.
We are using a **stateful widget**, which has a `Counter` object
in its state. 
We add the `_incrementCounter()` and `_decrementCounter()` functions
which in turn change the state of the widget by
incrementing/decrementing the counter. 

In the `build()` function, we use the `Center` widget
to center the contets of the page. 
Inside this, we add a `Column`
that centers the contents using `MainAxisAlignment.center`.
The contents of this `Column are three-fold:
- a `Text` string 'You have pushed the button this many times:'
- a `Text` that prints the `counter` value
- a `Row` that has two `FloatingActionButton`s. 
One button increments and the other decrements the counter.

The application is complete.
In Visual Studio, on the bottom bar,
click on the device you want to emulate.
We are going to use an iPhone 14 Pro Max emulator
to showcase the application. 

After choosing the device, click `F5` or 
`Run > Start Debugging`. 
This will build the app and run it in the emulator.

Your app should now look like this :tada:.

# Running on a real device ðŸ¤³
Having an emulator is handy but at the end of the day,
users are going to be using the application on their devices
either be it an Android or an iPhone.

Let's do a rundown on how to get it working
on an Android Device. 
Don't worry, it is super easy!

Firstly, you need to connect your phone to the computer
with a USB Cable. 
Your device needs to have **Developer Option** and 
**USB Debugging** turned on in the device settings. 
In OnePlus' case, this is where you turn it on.

![dev_option](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17494745/201945785-4aff62a2-5dee-42a4-8e04-bef94d673129.png)

If you're not finding the developer option, go to `About`
section of the phone in the settings
and tap the build number multiple times, 
until a message shows that you are now a developer.

The steps should look like the following image.

![steps](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17494745/201946301-38c30ce5-25e9-44a1-9557-ef7208ef97c8.png)

After having these settings turned on and your device connected to the computer,
you can check if the device is being detected by running:

```sh
flutter devices
```

In our case, by running this command, we verify that
our OnePlus is detected.

<img width="661" alt="device_detected" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17494745/201946732-a45299e6-66b4-4ef2-9499-f62a2190ec2c.png">

Since we are working on Visual Studio Code, 
we can now choose this device to run our app in.

![device_picker](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17494745/201946939-b37b37d4-c164-403d-b49c-f122ddb1088e.png)

Let's choose it and run the app by clicking `F5`
or `Run > Start debugging`.

> If this is your first time running on 
> an Android device/emulator, it might take some time
> so Gradle downloads all the needed dependencies, binaries and
> respective SDKs to build the app to be run on the app. 
> Just make sure you have a solid internet connection.
> If you wanto to check the traces of what it's doing
> "behind the scenes", instead of running through VSCode,
> type `flutter run -v` after selecting the device, instead.
> This will print the trace logs as it builds the app.

> :warning: If by any chance you interrupted this iniial setup, 
> chances are your `gradle` download is corrupted and 
> it shows a [timeout error](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67072304/flutter-throwing-error-timeout-of-x-reached-waiting-for-exclusive-access-to-fil)
> when you run `flutter run -v`. 
> To fix this, simply go to your `Home` folder 
> (type `echo $HOME` to see the directory path)
> and delete the `.gradle` folder. 
> If you re-run `flutter run -v` or do it through VSCode,
> it will download the dependencies on a clean slate again.

You should now see your app working on your 
mobile device! :tada:

# Test coverage and actions ðŸšš

To get the test coverage, we are going to simply run 
three commands. However, firstly, if you are on MacOS,
you need to install `lcov`. For this, run the following command
to install it in your computer.

```sh
brew install lcov
```

Now, to get the coverage, run the following commands.

```sh
# Generate `coverage/lcov.info` file
flutter test --coverage
# Generate HTML report
genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/html
# Open the report
open coverage/html/index.html
```

The generated HTML will create files inside
the `coverage/` folder. Add it to your 
`.gitignore` file.

Your browser should have opened a window, 
like so.

<img width="1013" alt="coverage" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17494745/201938273-c22fe031-7247-4cbd-b0ed-708b70b662a9.png">

## Continuous integration
Now that we set up and know how to get coverage,
let's create a pipeline that will run these tests
everytime someone commits to the `main` branch,
and get this coverage on [Codecov](https://about.codecov.io/),
so we can display this coverage if we want to :smile:.

For this, we can leverage Github Actions, 
which will allow us to create a pipeline that is executed
everytime a commit is made in `main` or a PR is made to be merged to it.
Github checks for the `.github` directory in their repos for this.
So let's create a `.github/workflows` folder
to add our configuration file `ci.yml` in.

> Github Actions supports several frameworks 
> and languages out of the box. 
> If you are interested in learning more, 
> check their docs -> https://github.com/features/actions

```yml
name: flutter_tests

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout the code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
```

In this **pipeline** named "flutter_tests", we are telling
Github that we want to execute it everytime a push on 
or PR is made to the `main` branch. 
We then set up a **job** called "tests"
that will run on an `ubuntu`-based environmennt.

In this job, we are going to be defining steps
that will be executed. 
The first one we added checks out the code on the branch.

Let's add another step.

```yml
- name: Install and set Flutter version
        uses: subosito/flutter-action@v1.4.0
        with:
          flutter-version: '3.3.8'
```

In this step, we are using an 
[action created by the community](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/flutter-action)
that creats an environmnent to run our code on.

Let's add more steps.

```yml
- name: Restore packages
  run: flutter pub get

- name: Analyze
  run: flutter analyze

- name: Run tests
  run: flutter test --coverage
```

We just added three steps. 
In the first one, we are downloading the dependencies of the project.
In the second step, we are analyzing the code.
In the last one, we are testing the code and generating the
coverage, creating a `coverage` folder with a `lcov.info` file in it.
This file will be used by Codecov to generate an overview of the code coverage.

We now need to connect to Codecov. 
If you login to Codecov using Github,
you will see the repositories you have control over.
Repositories that are not setup for Codecov will appear like so.
The setup for Codecov is accessible by clicking the
"setup repo" link. 

<img width="1348" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17494745/202000844-8693d002-43ac-4205-83a4-af247d4e7894.png">

After following these steps,
if you have a public repository, you can simply add
the following step to the `ci.yml` file.

```yml
- name: Upload coverage to codecov
  run: curl -s https://codecov.io/bash
  shell: bash
```

If you are dealing with a private repository,
use the token as a Github Secret provided in the `Codecov` repo setup page
you clicked before and then add the following to the `ci.yml` file.

```yml
- name: Upload coverage to codecov
  run: curl -s https://codecov.io/bash -t $
  shell: bash
```

And you should be done!
